# Ski Tracker Client (STC)

An epic flutter project

code is old, don't get any brain damage plz
This project has had its fair share of abuse, so it now no longer really serves as
a 'client' for the dadjoke generator thingy I had in mind first. I honestly have no clue what it really
is, besides a funny look into my brain a few years back lmaooo
